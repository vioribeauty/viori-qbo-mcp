> **Viori fork.** This fork runs as a hosted Streamable HTTP server on Railway (`src/http-server.ts`), not a local stdio process:
> - Intuit OAuth: `GET /` (launch), `GET /callback`, `GET|POST /disconnect` (revoke). Tokens are AES-256-GCM encrypted in Postgres (`qbo` schema); the rotated refresh token is saved on every refresh. A connected company can't be replaced by a different realm without disconnecting first.
> - `/mcp` requires `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`, either as a static `Authorization: Bearer` header or typed into the OAuth sign-in page that claude.ai custom connectors open.
> - Every write tool accepts `dry_run` (returns the exact payloads, posts nothing). Every write stamps the record's internal memo with `[Claude]` (`src/helpers/write-guard.ts`); deletes/voids stamp the record first, then delete.
> - Added: `get_transaction_list`, `delete_account` (make inactive). Fixed: `delete-vendor` (now makes inactive; node-quickbooks has no vendor delete).
> - Env: `QBO_CLIENT_ID`, `QBO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `QBO_ENVIRONMENT`, `QBO_REDIRECT_URI`, `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`, `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, optional `QBO_REALM_ID` (pin one company).

## Overview

This MCP server provides complete QuickBooks Online API integration for Claude Code and other MCP-compatible clients. It includes full CRUD operations for 29 entity types and 11 financial reports, giving you comprehensive access to QuickBooks Online functionality.

### Key Features

- **145 Total Tools** - Complete coverage of QuickBooks Online API
- **29 Entity Types** - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search)
- **11 Financial Reports** - Balance Sheet, P&L, Cash Flow, and more
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication** - Secure token-based authentication
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety with Zod validation
- **Tested** - Jest test suite with ESM support

> Note: this is a local MCP server. It runs as a stdio subprocess on the developer's or partner's machine and authenticates to a QuickBooks Online company.

> **Before you start:** This MCP server is easy to run once authenticated, but QuickBooks Online integration is gated by Intuit's OAuth app setup. You must register an app on the [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com) and complete a one-time, browser-based OAuth handshake. **Sandbox** supports `http://localhost` redirect URIs; **production** requires a public HTTPS callback for the initial authorization. After that initial handshake, the server runs locally without further browser interaction (until the 100-day refresh window lapses). See [Authentication](#authentication) for full details.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-quickbooks-online.git
cd mcp-quickbooks-online

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Configuration

Copy the template `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
QUICKBOOKS_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
QUICKBOOKS_REALM_ID=your_realm_id

# Optional: restrict which tool categories are registered (default: all enabled)
# QUICKBOOKS_DISABLE_WRITE=true    # suppress create_* tools
# QUICKBOOKS_DISABLE_UPDATE=true   # suppress update_* tools
# QUICKBOOKS_DISABLE_DELETE=true   # suppress delete_* tools
```

`.env` is gitignored so your real credentials stay local.

> **Read-only or containerized installs:** the server reads `.env` at startup and writes the rotated refresh token back to it on each refresh. When the installed module sits on a **read-only filesystem** (a container with a read-only root, an immutable/Nix install), set `QUICKBOOKS_TOKEN_STORE_PATH` to an absolute, writable path for both operations. A per-tenant host can also point each connection at its own isolated token file this way. Three things to know: it must be set in the **host process env** (e.g. the `env` block of your MCP server config) — setting it inside `.env` has no effect, because the path is resolved before `.env` is read; it must be an **absolute** path (the server refuses to start otherwise); and when set, the package's own `.env` is not read at all, so any file-based config (including credentials) must live in the file it points to.

### Claude Code Integration

Add to your Claude Code MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quickbooks": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/mcp-quickbooks-online/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
        "QUICKBOOKS_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token",
        "QUICKBOOKS_REALM_ID": "your_realm_id",
        "QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT": "sandbox",
        "QUICKBOOKS_DISABLE_WRITE": "false",
        "QUICKBOOKS_DISABLE_UPDATE": "false",
        "QUICKBOOKS_DISABLE_DELETE": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set any of the `DISABLE_*` flags to `"true"` to prevent that category of tools from being registered. Read tools (`get_*`, `search_*`) are always available.

## Authentication

This server uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate to a QuickBooks Online company. You'll set up an app on the [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com/) and connect it to either a **sandbox** (for development) or your **production** QBO company.

### Important: Sandbox vs Production

| Mode | When to use | Redirect URI accepted | Setup difficulty |
|------|-------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Sandbox** | Development, testing, demos | `http://localhost:8000/callback` works | Easy |
| **Production** | Real company data | Localhost **rejected** — must be a public HTTPS URL | Harder (see below) |

If you only want to read your own company's data, you still need to set up an app — Intuit does not offer per-user API keys. There is no shortcut around the OAuth + app-creation flow.

### Sandbox Setup (recommended for first run)

1. Go to the [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com/) and create a new app
2. Open the app → **Settings** (left sidebar) → **Redirect URIs** → add: `http://localhost:8000/callback`
3. Get your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the app's **Keys & Credentials** page (Development keys)
4. Create or use a sandbox company under the **Sandbox** top-level menu item in the dev portal
5. Set `QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` in your `.env`
6. Run `npm run auth` to complete the OAuth handshake — your browser will open, you sign in to the sandbox company, tokens are saved to `.env`

### Production Setup

The Intuit Developer Portal **rejects `http://localhost` redirect URIs in production mode** — every contributor hits this. Two known workarounds:

1. **ngrok tunnel (most common):** run `ngrok http 8000`, then on your Intuit app go to **Settings → Redirect URIs** and add the generated `https://<id>.ngrok-free.app/callback` URL. Use that URL for the OAuth handshake, then revert to localhost afterwards.
2. **Deploy a small public callback handler** (e.g., on a VPS or serverless function) that captures the auth code and hands it back to your local setup. More involved; only needed if you can't use ngrok.

After completing the production OAuth handshake, the refresh token is what matters — once it's in `.env`, you no longer need the public redirect URL for day-to-day use. Refresh tokens auto-rotate; the server persists the new token on each refresh.

### Once you have tokens

```env
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
QUICKBOOKS_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
QUICKBOOKS_REALM_ID=your_realm_id
QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or 'production'
```

### Common pitfalls

- **`.env` loaded from the wrong directory.** The server resolves `.env` relative to the compiled module, not your shell's CWD. If you launch via Claude Desktop, this matters — make sure you're on current `main`.
- **Redirect URI mismatch.** The URI you register in the Intuit portal must match **exactly** — protocol, host, port, path. `http://localhost:8000/callback` .

## Error Handling

If you encounter connection errors:

1. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
2. Check that tokens are valid and not expired
3. Ensure the QuickBooks app has the correct redirect URIs
4. For sandbox testing, use `QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox`

### Tool naming convention

All tool names must follow the `{verb}_{entity}` convention using underscores. The verb prefix determines CRUD Restriction Mode behaviour:

| Prefix | Category | Suppressed by |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| `create_` | WRITE | `QUICKBOOKS_DISABLE_WRITE=true` |
| `update_` | UPDATE | `QUICKBOOKS_DISABLE_UPDATE=true` |
| `delete_` | DELETE | `QUICKBOOKS_DISABLE_DELETE=true` |
| `get_`, `search_`, `read_` | READ | never |

New tools that do not follow this convention will not be correctly categorised and may appear or be suppressed unexpectedly.
